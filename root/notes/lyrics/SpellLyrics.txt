[Verse 1]
Slow
Come and kiss me slow
No, I don’t have to go
Show me all there is to know

All of the lights are down
But I see right through you, dear
It’s silent as we trade mouths
But I hear you loud and clear

[Hook]
I know you don’t fall and tell
But darling I know you too well
You don’t think that heaven’s real
So I’ll love you ’til it hurts like hell
’til God breaks this spell

[Verse 2]
Deep
Bury your love deep
You can plant your trust in me
I laid down yellow bricks where you thought you were gonna have to leap, oh

You don’t even have to try
I'll stay through mighty swings
You’ll say, “All the stakes are high”
Well baby that’s why we’ve got wings

[Hook]
I know you don’t fall and tell
But darling, I know you too well
You don’t think that heaven’s real
So I’ll love you ’til it hurts like hell
’til God breaks this spell

[Intro]
Yeah
Mhmm

[Verse 1]
And there she goes
She's sitting real nice with her head full of advice from friends
She walks around
She tries to rearrange but everything goes under her bed

[Verse 2]
And it's countless
She's got a jar full of change saved up for vacation
And she's watching
She's watching her sons growing up just like their mom
And it's hard, for her

[Hook]
And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed

[Bridge]
Yeah she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose
She got a call from a guy just seeing if she's alright
(better not panic, better not panic, better not panic)

[Verse 3]
She's got a face full of tears held back by the strength of five
And she says, "Happiness ain't free
Everybody fights just like me
But I've given up the ability to retreat"

[Hook]
And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
You gotta start lifting your head up, head up, head up
And I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I know it's hard but you gotta get outta bed, outta bed, outta bed

[Bridge]
Yeah she don't know what to do
She's got everything and nothing to lose

[Verse 4]
There's time for us to figure it out
I'm there so don't be scared
There's time for us to figure it out
I'm there, I am there

[Outro]
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
I said Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
All alone, rest your head on my lap when you're down (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby
Ruby, Ruby
All alone, rest your head on my lap, on my lap (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
When you're down (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
(Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
Oooooo (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
Ruby don't cry
Cause I am here, and I am here (Ruby, Ruby, Ruby)
So don't you cry
Cause it'll be alright
